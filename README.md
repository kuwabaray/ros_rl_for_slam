# ROS Path planning for SLAM by training a DQN model on Gazebo
This ia a ROS meta package. it simulates Turtlebot3 movement on Gazebo and trains a rainforcement learning model DQN.  
I mainly refer this thesis [REINFORCEMENT LEARNING HELPS SLAM: LEARNING TO BUILD MAPS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343874756_REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_HELPS_SLAM_LEARNING_TO_BUILD_MAPS)

## Description
* **dqn\_for\_slam**: RL Enviroment (gym) and trainig a DQN model (Keras-rl2, Tensorflow) 
* **rosbot\_description**: Based on [rosbot\_description](https://github.com/husarion/rosbot_description). turned off camera and Infrared for computational load and reduced friction. 
* **simulate\_robot\_rl**: The entry point of training
* **simulate\_map**: Map for simulation
* **slam\_gmapping**: Based on [slam\_gmapping](https://github.com/ros-perception/slam\_gmapping). Added the service and functions that clear a map and restart gmapping.

## Dependency
This application don't require GPU.
I run on 
* Ubuntu 20.04 
* ROS Noetic
install frameworks to run 
```bash
pip3 install matplotlib tensorflow gym numpy keras-rl2 rospkg
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
```
## Usage
Run trainning 
 ```bash
roslaunch simulate_robot_rl simulate_robot.launch
```
Trained models are saved to ~/dqn\_for\_slam/dqn\_for\_slam/models/  
Figures show training process are saved to ~/dqn\_for\_slam/dqn\_for\_slam/figures/
